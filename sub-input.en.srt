1 
00:00:0,580 --> 00:00:3,780 
 This morning I wake up and I look in the mirror 

2 
00:00:3,780 --> 00:00:7,820 
 Every part of my body was in the place many people lie 

3 
00:00:7,820 --> 00:00:11,380 
 I don't wanna act too high and mighty 

4 
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,800 
 Cause tomorrow I may fall down on my face 

5 
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,380 
 Lord I thank you for sunshine, thank you for rain 

6 
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,640 
 Thank you for joy, thank you for pain 

7 
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,680 
 It's a beautiful day, it's a beautiful day
